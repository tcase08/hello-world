# hello-world
this project aims to create an open source erp system for local governments. This is a step to get governments to use open source software, made by it's citizens. Help build software that makes our country perform more efficently and open.

Local governments don't run as efficently due to technological challenges. It's expensive and they don't have the technical staff to keep it current. This project would build a platform that gives them this software for free, freeing up their budgets for public enhancements, rather than technology. I envision a webpage built into the software that would allow users to request technical assistance from other users and reduce a large number of helpdesk calls. I personally have zero experience with programming, but I do have experience with government and I know this will make a HUGE impact. Think of all the money that would be freed up and help local governments run much more efficently. I am very open to ideas and changes to this at this point.

I believe this project should be built in phases, but with an eye on the overall picture.

The guiding overall features should be a web based, HTML5 interface so that the software is mobile and available on all devices.
Lightweight, efficent software that is easy to customize for different users specific codes and regulations in their locality.
Easily scalable for large governments.
Excellent security.
Role based, task list, well documented.

Phase 1: Financials package (GL,JL, Grant Manangement, A/R, A/P, Bank Recon, Utility Billing, Budgeting, Fixed Assets, Inventory)

Phase 2: HR/Payroll package (Timekeeping interfaces, Employee Data, FMLA tracking, Benefits, Employee facing system to request changes and make benefit elections, Leave tracking, employee record keeping)

Phase 3: Reporting package (Probably just use an exsisting package like Cognos?)

Future developments: Public Safety applications, GIS data, public facing open government application, other items as requested.
